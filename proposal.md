# Pokemon Style Adventure Game

## Project Description

For my final project, my plan is to essentially recreate a Pokemon game. I plan on having the trainer or player start in a random region, fight a couple battles and collect pokemon, and then eventually have a boss battle with a gym trainer. 


## Needs To Have

- solid looking start screen with main menu
- at least two battles then boss battle
- battles with about 2-3 turns each side
- at least two moves per pokemon
- various types of pokemon 
- background music - especially for fight scene
- sound effects corresponding to pokemon


## Nice To Have
- pokedex feature where you can see pokemon in the region/pokemon collected
- different regions/map to get to different areas
- customizable player or at least choice between two players
- side quests
- npcs
- pokemon clinic
- inventory - equipped with medkits or berries
